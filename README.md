# drinking-problems

A fan project for my consumption problems with a certain supplement company :3

It's supposed to be an archive for GAMERSUPPS. (Because their archive sucks)
Everything they ever made and will make, will be archived here.
From forgotten products like the 2020 Corona Virus Merch,
to the oh so beloved Blo'Hole Blast.


---------- A bit about me and this projects idea -------------

I'm not alone on this, currently, I have a friend who helps me.
He's the guy who will make everything and anything art based.
I'm on the other hand, am responsible for the code.

That's why I also decided to learn how to use GitHub,
Because I think I'll learn more if I'm closer to a community full of nerds :)
(And because learning code in school is fun and all.. but a bit slow)


As of writing this, I have no idea what I'm doing.
All I have, is a years worth of knowledge on CSS and HTML from school.
But with this project, I don't just want to make a small idea become real,
but I also want to grow myself with this.
My goal with this, is to become a somewhat decent coder,
because I think it's fun, and I want to do this as a living in the future.

If for whatever reason you decided to visit this weird project, and even read trough this,
thanks, firstly. And secondly, I hope I can humor you a little with my perfectly written code :*

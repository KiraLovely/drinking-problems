# drinking-problems

A fan project for my consumption problems with a certain supplement company :3

It's supposed to be an archive for GAMERSUPPS. (Because their archive sucks)
Everything they ever made and will make, will be archived here.
From forgotten products like the 2020 Corona Virus Merch,
to the oh so beloved Blo'Hole Blast.


------------- A bit about me and this projects idea -------------

I'm not alone on this Project, currently, I have a friend who helps me.
He's the guy who will make everything and anything art based.
I'm on the other hand, am responsible for the code.

That's why I also decided to learn how to navigate GitHub,
Because I think I'll learn more if I'm closer to a community full of nerds :)\
(And because learning code in school is fun and all.. but a bit slow)


As of writing this, I have no idea what I'm doing.
All I have, is a years worth of knowledge on CSS and HTML from school.
But with this project, I don't just want to make a small idea become real,
but I also want to grow myself with this.
My goal with this, is to become a somewhat decent coder,
because I think it's fun, and I want to do this as a living in the future.

If for whatever reason you decided to visit this weird project, and even read trough this,
thanks, firstly. And secondly, I hope I can humor you a little with my perfectly written code :*


------------- 10/10/2025: First Update -------------

Hey, hey~,\
I thought I might add like an Update/Story, thing, to this whole Project.
Documenting a little and talking about life, relations to the project bla bla.

To start with, I want to recognize that over the summer vacation I absolutely forgot about this.
I neglected the project and was too lazy to pick it up again.
I could've done so much in that time, but oh well.
But I'm back! And so is my motivation.  I'm back in school, and currently learning JS.
Learning JS, having fun with the script, I got motivated again, and now, I'm back.
More ready than ever. Better than ever. Because I'm actively learning a new language to help this project.

To continue my litte writing explosion for now, I wanted to say that
the project is technically live on the web. I've hosted it via Cloudflare basically since day one.
And now my little domain is running out, which is fine.
The domain name is "kiraminecraft.org", as you might guess, I didn't intend to use it for something like this.
I'm letting it run out, and I'm getting a new one. This will happen sometime next year in May.
So, my goal for now is to get the website into a half finished, usable, website,
so I can host it over a new domain, and officially, announce the website to the public.

I'd probably want to do this over the reddit, r/gamersupps, maybe it'll gain some traction then.
And I'd gladly hope for some input and feedback from the community this is for.

So for any of you, who might read this before May 2026, or the new domain-name,
here is the passcode :) GGA8340853arikorp , just type this into the little box and be ready to be horrified haha.


------------- 26/10/2025: Small talk -------------

Hey, hey~\
Here I am again, with a little update/ramble. So this is, a day, after pull-request #15,
I've just update the Navbar, and I'm unsure if I like the change or not. 

For context, I changed the Consumables Button (Cons)
from just being a button, to a dropdown menu. And, I don't know really. At first, I liked it,
but now it feels a bit clunky. But maybe it's just me again. 
I've also had a big problem with the old font we used, it bugged all the time, 
and I couldn't really be happy about anything, when opening the site. 
Maybe it'll be the same here, where I burn my head off for the next few weeks, 
and eventually find a small tweak that'll satisfy me.\

Anyway, I realised that GitHub, apparently only focuses on file extensions.
So I moved the little JavaScript I have, into actual JS files. Yay. Now everybody can see how horrible it is!

I've also had a little discussion with my friend, about the name of our website,
and surprise surprise we've even come up with a name that we think fits.
I'm not going to leak it for now, because we're still waiting for the old domain to run out,
so until that happens, be patient :)
